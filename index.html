  <h2>Welcome to Wolfpack Neurotech!</h2>
  <p>
    Wolfpack Neurotech is a student run organization committed to spreading education and building meaningful projects at 
    the intersection of neuroscience, biomedical engineering, electrical engineering, machine learning, materials science, and more. 
    We aim to create a community of students who are passionate about applying technology to improve the lives of those around them.
